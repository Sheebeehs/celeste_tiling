## Celeste classic tiling guide  

Here I'll try to explain a few tiling tips with pictures:

If you have a large block of tiles, try to break it up with some corner and wall pieces

<br><br>

You will see plenty of tiling, taking advantage of corner blocks to segment the tiles. Now, look at the same image, but with virtually no tiling:

It looks a lot less interesting.

When you have a corner or wall tile that is not facing air, it should face another corner or wall tile. (horrible explanation ik) For example, here:

It isn't the worst and is mostly preference, but I think it looks a bit stranger than having more corners to face it. (this is mostly bc my tiling style is very based off of the original celeste classic's tiling, so if you like the tiling in the above image, go ahead :yadelie:)

Use more of those weird tiles that are blank except for dots. I have 0 clue how to explain this properly so have an image:

Unless your levels have thin tiling, leaving barely any space to put these tiles down, I would recommend randomly sticking a lot of them in empty space to make it look a bit less empty (again, personal preference for this one)

You can also just make a tileset like the one in Dark Celeste, which is literally just black and white outlines, and it still looks great without much tiling.

Study vanilla tiling and get a feel for that. Even if you don't like vanilla tiling that much, it's still a good place to start.

BG tile every level you can, this is slightly hypocritical because the screenshots I added don't have BG tiles, but that's mostly because I am lazy and can't be bothered to do it yet. BG tiles fill up the air in levels that would otherwise (usually) feel empty.

I can't really think of any more tips now but I'll edit the page whenever I think of more.
